# Homework 3 - Password Generator

## Description
This project provides the user with a randomly generated password that they can choose to include lowercase letters, uppercase numbers, and/or symbols. The user then can copy the randomly generated password to the clipboard

## How to run
This project contains three files: 'index.html', 'script.js', and 'style.css'. These files load the HTML, javascript and CSS of this webpage (respectively). To load the page, open the index.html file.

## Usage
When the page loads, you may select boxes next to each character type (symbols, letters, etc) and these characters will be included into the password. Click the generate password button to have a new randon password displayed. Click the copy text button to have the password copied to the clipboard which you may then paste into a text field anywhere on your computer.
